My goal for this visual argument is to make aware the very pressing issue of climate change and the need for immediate action to preserve our planet. In this preview, I am showing the main focal point of the poster. I sourced 3 images of climates that are most affected by human pollution and destruction. The top image is the rapidly dissapearing polar ice caps, the middle image is of the tropical rainforests being hit by human deforestation and the bottom image is of the coral reefs suffering from ocean pollution. All of these images are from Unsplash. I scaled each of the images down and then cropped each to the part of the picture I wanted and I merged all layers into one. I then used alpha to selection tool and layer mask to fit the images inside the number 1 text. I then used the stroke tool to make a thick white outline around the text. This potion of my poster will be the largest and most colorful to have the largest impact. Future steps for me will be to pick a font that I feel matches the vibe of my poster and will be convey my message. I need to then put in my sentences. I also need to import an alarm clock image from the Noun Project and add my own numbers inside the image to add the accurate time of the climate clock. I imagine "We only have" being placed above the 1 at the top of the poster, "Planet." at the bottom right of the 1, "...and we're running out of time" at the bottom left of the poster, and the clock image at the bottom right of the poster.
