This visual argument is called "Running Out of Time". I am arguing for awareness of and actions to prevent global climate change and the degredation of our environment, through the idea of the Climate CLock. Environmental conservation and sustainability is very important to me and I think it is something often overlooked by others or even disregarded because they believe their small actions don't really have an effect. I hope that this poster reminds each person that they have a responsibility to the planet that we all live on to keep it clean. My visual argument is based on the concept of the Climate Clock. It is a running countdown of the time we have left as a collective Earth to achieve zero carbon emissions by. This concept articulates the urgency of this issue as well as puts something tangible behind this massive overwhelming concept. My audience for this visual argument is targeted towards those individuals that need a reminder or awareness that changes need to be made, especially the younger generations because these are the people that are going to influence the future. I chose to make a palatte of shades of blue for my poster because I felt that this neutral and earth-like color combination fits with the concept and content of the poster.
